                My name is Joshua Haxton. I am currently an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Kansas from Jefferson City, MO. 
                I am looking for a summer internship for 2021. I have experience in many different programming languages and have worked as an Information Technology/Application
                Developer Intern during the summer of 2020. I have been involved in many extra-cirricular activites while at KU. Through these activites, I have been able to further 
                develop interpersonal skills and dabble in applications of Computer Science. I created this website to fully showcase who I am and the skills I could bring to table. 
                Please feel free to contact me with any questions that you may have while looking at this site.
                <br> <br> Thanks, <br> <br>
